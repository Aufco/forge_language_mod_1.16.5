# Language Display Mod - Development Notes

## Project Overview
This is a Minecraft Forge mod for version 1.16.5 that displays real-time language translations for in-game elements with interactive Spanish audio support.

## Technical Details

### Mod Structure
- **Mod ID**: `languagemod`
- **Main Class**: `com.example.languagemod.LanguageDisplayMod`
- **Forge Version**: 36.2.34
- **Minecraft Version**: 1.16.5

### Key Components

1. **Translation System**
   - Loads translation files from `translation_keys/1.16.5/` directory
   - Supports English (`en_us.json`) and Spanish (`es_mx.json`)
   - Uses Gson for JSON parsing
   - Translation keys follow Minecraft's standard format (e.g., `block.minecraft.stone`)

2. **Audio System (`AudioManager.java`)**
   - Loads audio mapping from `audio/es_mx/audio_mapping.json`
   - Maps translation keys to MP3 files
   - Supports 4,800+ Spanish audio pronunciations
   - Uses Windows Media Player, default system player, or PowerShell as fallbacks
   - Cross-platform audio support (Windows/Mac/Linux)

3. **Input Handler (`KeyInputHandler.java`)**
   - Registers F key binding for audio playback
   - Detects what player is looking at (blocks, entities)
   - Falls back to held item when not targeting anything
   - Generates appropriate translation keys for audio lookup

4. **HUD Overlay Renderer**
   - Subscribes to `RenderGameOverlayEvent.Text` event
   - Renders clean, minimal information in top-left corner
   - Updates in real-time as player moves/looks around
   - Color-coded headers (yellow) and content (white)

### Displayed Information
- Player's current position coordinates
- Biome information with English/Spanish translations
- Targeted block/entity details with translations (contextual)
- Held item translations (when applicable)

### Audio Implementation
- **Audio Files**: 4,800+ MP3 files in `audio/es_mx/` directory
- **Mapping**: JSON file maps translation keys to audio filenames
- **Playback**: Multiple fallback methods for cross-platform compatibility
- **Trigger**: F key plays audio for current target or held item

### Implementation Notes
- Uses Minecraft's registry system to get namespaced IDs
- Translation keys generated by converting namespaced IDs (e.g., `minecraft:stone` → `block.minecraft.stone`)
- File paths are Windows-specific but audio system adapts to OS
- Clean, minimal UI design focused on language learning
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

### Build Configuration
- Uses Gradle 7.3.3
- Java 8 compatibility
- MCP mappings for 1.16.5

### Audio File Structure
```
audio/es_mx/
├── audio_mapping.json (maps keys to files)
├── block_minecraft_*.mp3 (block pronunciations)
├── item_minecraft_*.mp3 (item pronunciations)
├── entity_minecraft_*.mp3 (entity pronunciations)
└── biome_minecraft_*.mp3 (biome pronunciations)
```

### Usage Flow
1. Player looks at block/entity or holds item
2. Mod displays English/Spanish translations in HUD
3. Player presses F key
4. Mod determines translation key for current target
5. Audio system looks up corresponding MP3 file
6. Spanish pronunciation plays through system audio

### Key Classes
- `LanguageDisplayMod`: Main mod class, event registration, translation loading
- `AudioManager`: Audio file mapping and playback management
- `KeyInputHandler`: F key detection and target identification
- `OverlayRenderer`: HUD display rendering (inner class)

### Future Enhancements
- Configuration GUI for audio settings
- Additional language support
- Toggle key for HUD display
- Volume controls
- Modded content support
