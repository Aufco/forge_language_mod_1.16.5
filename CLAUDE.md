# Language Display Mod - Development Notes

## Project Overview
This is a Minecraft Forge mod for version 1.16.5 that displays real-time language translations for in-game elements.

## Technical Details

### Mod Structure
- **Mod ID**: `languagemod`
- **Main Class**: `com.example.languagemod.LanguageDisplayMod`
- **Forge Version**: 36.2.34
- **Minecraft Version**: 1.16.5

### Key Components

1. **Translation System**
   - Loads translation files from `translation_keys/1.16.5/` directory
   - Supports English (`en_us.json`) and Spanish (`es_mx.json`)
   - Uses Gson for JSON parsing
   - Translation keys follow Minecraft's standard format (e.g., `block.minecraft.stone`)

2. **HUD Overlay Renderer**
   - Subscribes to `RenderGameOverlayEvent.Text` event
   - Renders information in top-left corner of screen
   - Updates in real-time as player moves/looks around

3. **Displayed Information**
   - Player's current block position
   - Biome information with translations
   - Targeted block details with translations
   - Held item (main hand) with translations
   - Entity under crosshair with translations

### Implementation Notes

- The mod uses Minecraft's registry system to get namespaced IDs
- Translation keys are generated by converting namespaced IDs (e.g., `minecraft:stone` â†’ `block.minecraft.stone`)
- File paths are hardcoded for the translation JSON files (Windows-specific paths)
- The overlay renderer uses MatrixStack for proper rendering in 1.16.5

### Build Configuration
- Uses Gradle 7.3.3
- Java 8 compatibility
- MCP mappings for 1.16.5

### Future Improvements
- Make translation file paths configurable
- Add support for more languages
- Create configuration GUI for display settings
- Add toggle key to show/hide overlay
- Support for modded items/blocks translations
